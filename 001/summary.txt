**3.2. Backend Structure & API Endpoints**

The backend codebase is structured logically within the `server/` directory, adhering to a clear separation of concerns.

*   `server/controllers/`: Contains the core business logic for handling specific API requests. Each controller function processes incoming data, interacts with the database (via ORM), and prepares the response.
    *   `predictController.ts`: Handles logic related to breed recognition requests (e.g., processing image, calling AI model).
    *   `breedController.ts`: Manages operations related to breed data (e.g., fetching breed information).
*   `server/routes/`: Defines the API endpoints and maps them to the appropriate controller functions. This ensures a clean and organized API surface.
    *   `predictRoutes.ts`: Routes for breed prediction.
    *   `breedRoutes.ts`: Routes for breed data.
*   `server/types/`: TypeScript declaration files for custom types (e.g., `express-session.d.ts`).
*   `server/utils/`: Contains utility functions and configurations, such as database connection setup (`db.ts`).
*   `server/index.ts`: The main entry point for the Express application, where middleware is configured and routes are registered.
